# New York Times ReactJS Search

## What is it?

An app that allows users to search for New York Times articles on any given topic, published between any 2 given years. Users have the option to save search results (and later delete them, if they so choose), or view them on the original site. The app utilizes the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. 

The most current version of the site is deployed at https://hidden-basin-61513.herokuapp.com/ .

## Browser and Screen Compatibility

### Browser Tests

The site has been tested so far in Chrome, Firefox, and the latest version of Internet Explorer.
It functions fully on all of these browsers.

Plans to test on Safari upcoming.

### Screen Compatibility Tests

The site is best viewed on a small desktop (1280x800), but looks good on essentially any modern device's screen resolution. This includes both a 10" and 12" Netbook, a 13" and 15" notebook, 19"-24" desktops, Kindle Fire, Asus Nexus 7, iPad and iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy tab, Microsoft Surface Pro, iPhone 3 and up (including iPhone 6-7 plus), Galaxy S2 and up, LG G 3-5, and 480p, 720p and 1080p televisions. 

When loaded properly on a desktop, notebook, or tablet, the homepage should look like this:

The "saved" page should look like this:

The mobile layout of the site should look like this:

## Future Plans for Improvement
* Add individual user accounts/logins.
* Add an alert after a user saves an article that lets them know the article has been saved.
* Make it so that clicking the "save" button on the same article multiple times will not cause it to apear multiple times in the "saved" section.
* Add a little more stylistic CSS flair so the design is not so plain.
